MCP Server for Paddle Billing
Paddle Billing is the developer-first merchant of record. We take care of payments, tax, subscriptions, and metrics with one unified API that does it all.

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLMs and AI agents with tools for interacting with the Paddle API.

Important: This MCP server works with Paddle Billing. It does not support Paddle Classic. To work with Paddle Classic, see: Paddle Classic API reference

Install in Cursor



Features

View customer, purchase, and provisioning information
Handle subscription, payment, and refund workflows
Debug billing and order management issues
Create and adjust transactions directly in conversation
Generate financial reports for financial and operational insights

Installation
To use the MCP server, you'll need an API key. You can create and manage API keys in Paddle > Developer tools > Authentication:

Sandbox: https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/authentication-v2
Live: https://vendors.paddle.com/authentication-v2
Adding the following to your MCP settings file will configure and run the Paddle MCP server in a client like Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf:

Method 1: One-click installation in Cursor or VS Code
You can install the Paddle MCP server with a single click in Cursor or VS Code.

Install in Cursor



After installation, you'll need to update the configuration in your MCP settings file to replace your_api_key with your actual Paddle API key and adjust the environment and tools values as needed.

Method 2: Using command-line arguments (Recommended for npx)
Add the following to the MCP settings or configuration file in the client you're using:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paddle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@paddle/paddle-mcp",
        "--api-key=your_api_key",
        "--environment=sandbox",
        "--tools=non-destructive"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Replace your_api_key with your actual Paddle API key, set --environment to either sandbox or production, and set --tools to the tools which you want to be loaded and available to the MCP client.

Method 3: Using environment variables
Add the following to the MCP settings or configuration file in the client you're using:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paddle": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paddle/paddle-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PADDLE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox",
        "PADDLE_MCP_TOOLS": "non-destructive"
      }
    }
  }
}
Replace your_api_key with your actual Paddle API key, set PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT to either sandbox or production, and set PADDLE_MCP_TOOLS to the tools which you want to be loaded and available to the MCP client.

Filtering tools
You can filter which tools are loaded and available to the MCP client by passing the --tools argument (Method 2) or setting the PADDLE_MCP_TOOLS environment variable (Method 1 or 3). Accepted values are:

all - All tools are available
read-only - Only read operations are available
non-destructive - Read operations and safe write operations are available (default)
A comma-separated list of specific tool names (e.g., list_products,get_product,create_product)
For detailed setup guides, see:

Claude Desktop
Cursor
Windsurf
Development
Install dependencies:

pnpm install
Build the server:

pnpm build
Update client to use the local build:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paddle": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/paddle-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PADDLE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox",
        "PADDLE_MCP_TOOLS": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
The PADDLE_MCP_TOOLS environment variable accepts the same values as the --tools argument: all, read-only, non-destructive, or a comma-separated list of tool names. If not set, defaults to non-destructive.

Debugging
To debug the MCP server, you can use the MCP Inspector tool:

Run the server with the inspector:

pnpm inspector
Open the provided URL in your browser to view and debug the MCP requests and responses.

Include the --api-key and --environment arguments.
