This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for https://boltroute.ai (the “Site”), including BoltRoute’s policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with your use of the Site and any related email verification services (the “Services”). When you access or use the Site or the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## PARTICIPATION IN EU-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK

BoltRoute complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. BoltRoute adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.

Pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks, should direct their query to support@boltroute.ai.

We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to support@boltroute.ai.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

BoltRoute may also store usage data such as the date and time the Site and Services are accessed, clickstream data, behavioral data like opens and clicks, and what information and files have been downloaded.

## Cookie Policy

What are cookies?

When you visit the Site or otherwise interact with the Services, BoltRoute may send one or more “cookies” to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers stored on your computer through your web browser and are used by most websites to record user activity and to personalize your web experience. Some cookies may facilitate Site features for enhanced performance and functionality such as remembering preferences, analyzing usage for Site optimization, and providing custom content. The length of time a cookie stays on your device varies depending on the type of cookie.

Strictly necessary cookies: Essential for us to deliver the Site and related Services to you securely and in compliance with applicable law. These cannot be disabled. Without these cookies, you will be unable to login to your BoltRoute account and access the Services through the Site.

## Personal Information Collected

To the extent that you elect to create an account on the Site, BoltRoute collects information that you submit in connection with your account (“Personal Information”), including your full name, email address, the password you select, phone number, company industry, and/or the third party social media account you may select to sign into the Services. To the extent that you purchase credits through the Site for the Services, or subscribe to purchase credits, your credit card/debit card number and related billing information will also be collected. Personal Information such as your name and email address are used to create a user account for the Site and Services, as well as for BoltRoute’s advertising and marketing purposes (such as email newsletters) and invoicing.

If you initiate a payment for the Services, BoltRoute may collect and store Personal Information, as well as any other information provided to us. BoltRoute encrypts credit card numbers using industry standard technology. This Personal Information may be shared with third parties such as Stripe to process your payment(s) for the Services.

To the extent that you elect to submit a Google Sheet containing Personal Information in conjunction with the Services, you understand that such information is shared with Google through your use of such. Information uploaded to the Site or otherwise submitted to BoltRoute in conjunction with the Services, including but not limited to CSV or TXT files, or through Google Sheets, may be stored encrypted for a period of thirty (30) days; however, you have the option to manually delete such information through the Customer dashboard.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, BoltRoute will keep your Personal Information private and will not sell or rent Personal Information to anyone.

## NOTICE TO UK AND EU RESIDENTS

Our legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Information will depend on the Personal Information collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We collect Personal Information when we have your consent to do so, where we need your personal information to perform any agreed-upon Services, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests.

## OPTING-OUT OF FUTURE CONTACTS

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new services, or changes to this Privacy Policy. You may opt-out of receiving promotional email by sending a request for removal to support@boltroute.ai or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email itself. BoltRoute will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, BoltRoute may still send you messages for administrative or other purposes directly relating to your use of the Services, and you cannot opt-out of receiving those messages.

You can do the following at any time by contacting us at support@boltroute.ai:

- See what data, including any Personal Information, we have about you;

- Request access to your Personal Information;

- Change/correct any data we have about you;

- Have us delete any data we have about you;

- Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

If you request deletion of your account, we may need to retain certain Personal Information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion. We may retain Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Site and Services, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements.

## CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Although we may not be a qualifying “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we voluntarily comply with its principles. California residents have the right to know what personal information we collect, request deletion of their data, and opt-out of the sale of their personal information. We do not sell personal information.

## SECURITY

We take precautions to protect your information. We maintain our Site and Services and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Site or Services that materially affects you or your Personal Information, we will attempt to notify you as soon as possible.

## DATA RETENTION

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Services, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Email lists and verification results submitted through our Services may be stored for up to thirty (30) days for service functionality, after which they are automatically deleted unless you manually delete them earlier through your dashboard.

## THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURES

To support our Services (email verification, list cleaning, customer support, payments, analytics, infrastructure), we may disclose your personal information—such as names, email addresses, IPs, and metadata—to our sub-processors and service providers. Each third party is contractually required to use data solely for the specified purpose, comply with applicable DPF principles, and maintain appropriate data protection safeguards. We do not sell, share for third-party marketing, or use personal data beyond the stated purposes.

## CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER

The Site and Services are controlled by BoltRoute. BoltRoute processes and stores Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection laws. To the extent that a BoltRoute customer transfers Personal Information originating in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, we implement appropriate safeguards, consistent with the laws of the applicable territory, including data processing addendums and standard contractual clauses where applicable. By using the Site and Services, you consent to the transfer of such information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country.

## DISPUTES

Individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy should first contact BoltRoute at support@boltroute.ai. In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, BoltRoute commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks.

BoltRoute reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. The date affixed next to the “Last Updated” legend above corresponds with the date the Privacy Policy was last revised. BoltRoute reserves the right, at any time, and without notice, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy.
