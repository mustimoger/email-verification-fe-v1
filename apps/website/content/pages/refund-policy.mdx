Last Updated: January 28, 2026

At BoltRoute, we want you to be completely satisfied with our email verification services. We offer a straightforward 14-day money-back guarantee for all new customers.

## 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee

If you are not satisfied with BoltRoute for any reason, you may request a full refund within 14 days of your initial purchase. This applies to:

- First-time credit purchases

- First-time subscription payments

No questions asked. Simply contact us and we will process your refund.

## How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, contact us at support@boltroute.ai with:

- Your account email address

- Date of purchase

- Reason for refund (optional, but helps us improve)

We will process your refund within 5-7 business days. Refunds are issued to the original payment method.

## Refund Conditions

- The 14-day guarantee applies to your first purchase only

- Refunds are available for unused or partially used credits

- Subscription refunds are prorated based on unused time within the 14-day window

## After the 14-Day Period

After the initial 14-day period, purchases are generally non-refundable. However, we handle refund requests on a case-by-case basis. If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using the service, contact us and we will work with you to find a fair resolution.

## Subscription Cancellations

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard or by contacting support@boltroute.ai. Cancellation stops future billing but does not automatically trigger a refund for the current billing period.
