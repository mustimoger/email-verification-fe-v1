## Worried about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance?

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.

BoltRoute is fully compliant with the requirements of a data processor under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). From day one, our primary goal was not only to offer you the best email verification system on the market, but also to keep your data safe during the process.
