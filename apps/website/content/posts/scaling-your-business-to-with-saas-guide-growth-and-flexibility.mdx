Scaling isn’t just about adding headcount — it’s about building repeatable systems that stay reliable as demand grows. SaaS platforms help teams move faster by turning fragile spreadsheets into shared, automated workflows.

<Callout title="Quick takeaway">

- Standardizes processes across teams and regions.
- Unlocks automation for routine handoffs.
