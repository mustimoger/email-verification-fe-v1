faq:
  - question: "Can I verify a 1000 email addresses list for free?"
    answer: "BoltRoute offers 100 free verifications to test the service. For a 1000 email addresses list, the Basic plan ($29/mo) covers up to 10,000 verifications - more than enough for your first list buy."
  - question: "Does BoltRoute verify HR directors email lists and HR executives email lists?"
    answer: "Yes. BoltRoute verifies any B2B list regardless of job title or seniority. HR directors, HR executives, recruiters, general managers - all processed the same way with full SMTP validation and risk scoring."
  - question: "Can I verify a general managers email list or recruiters email list from any data provider?"
    answer: "Yes. Upload lists sourced from any provider - ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, Seamless, or manually built. BoltRoute checks validity regardless of where your data originated."
  - question: "Should I verify a small business owners email list differently than enterprise lists?"
    answer: "Same process, different risk profile. Small business domains often have higher catch-all rates and less reliable mail servers. BoltRoute's risk scoring flags these so you can decide whether to send or skip."
  - question: "How do I verify a B2B lead generation database with thousands of records?"
    answer: "Upload your file (CSV, Excel, or text) via drag-and-drop. BoltRoute processes bulk email lists and returns downloadable results segmented by Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, and Role-based."
  - question: "Why do cold email experts recommend verifying purchased lists twice?"
    answer: "Data decays between when the vendor verified it and when you send. A list verified months ago may have a significant number of new invalids from job changes, domain shutdowns, and abandoned addresses. Verifying right before sending catches what the vendor missed."

## Buying Email Lists Is Just Step One. The Real Risk Comes After.

You paid for a leads database. Now what?

- **Data decays fast.** Job changes, company closures, and abandoned inboxes make a significant portion of B2B records invalid within months.
- **Bulk email lists hide dangers.** Spam traps, catch-all domains, and role-based addresses slip through data providers' filters.
- **One bad send = domain damage.** High bounce rates trigger ISP flags. Your domain can land on blacklists and cold outreach can stop working.

When you purchase a mailing list, you are buying unverified potential - not guaranteed deliverability.

## Clean Your Purchased Lists Before They Hit Your Sending Infrastructure

BoltRoute sits between your B2B lead database and your cold email tools. Upload any list - from any provider - and get back only verified, sendable addresses.

No more guessing which contacts are safe. No more hoping your data vendor did the work. The best B2B sales leads database is the one you have verified yourself.

## Verify Any B2B Email List - By Title, Industry, or Region

BoltRoute validates purchased lists regardless of source, segment, or geography.

<table className="has-fixed-layout">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>List Type</th>
      <th>What BoltRoute Does</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>HR email database</strong></td>
      <td>Catch outdated HR contacts before your recruiting outreach bounces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Professionals email list</strong></td>
      <td>Verify executive and decision-maker records from any data provider</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>UK business email list</strong></td>
      <td>Confirm regional data meets the same validation standards as US lists</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>List of company email addresses</strong></td>
      <td>Flag role-based addresses (info@, sales@, support@) that hurt deliverability</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Bulk uploads</strong></td>
      <td>Process thousands of records in minutes via CSV, Excel, or text file</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Every verification includes SMTP validation, syntax checks, domain health analysis, and risk scoring - so you know exactly which addresses to send to.

## From Purchased List to Verified Pipeline in 3 Steps

**Step 1: Get your list**
Buy from any B2B data provider or build your own. Knowing how to buy email lists is only half the job - how to get an email list ready for sending is what matters.

**Step 2: Upload to BoltRoute**
Drag and drop your CSV, Excel, or text file. No complex formatting required.

**Step 3: Download verified results**
Get your cleaned list segmented by Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, and Role-based. Send only to addresses that will not bounce.
