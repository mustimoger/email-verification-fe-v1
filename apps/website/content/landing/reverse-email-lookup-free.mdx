faq:
  - question: "Can I verify emails from any reverse lookup tool?"
    answer: "Yes. BoltRoute verifies emails from any source, including Hunter, Apollo, Snov, scraped lists, databases, or manual research. Upload a file or paste one address and BoltRoute verifies it regardless of where it came from."
  - question: "Is BoltRoute actually free?"
    answer: "You get 100 free verifications with no credit card required. No signup is needed for your first single-email test. Paid plans start at $29/mo when you need higher volume."
  - question: "How do I verify a traced email address?"
    answer: "Paste the address into BoltRoute's single email verifier. You get an instant result: valid, invalid, risky, catch-all, role-based, or disposable, plus diagnostics like domain health and SMTP status."
  - question: "What's the difference between email lookup and email verification?"
    answer: "Email lookup tools find addresses. Email verification checks whether an address is valid and safe to send to. Lookup finds them, verification protects you from bounces."
  - question: "Can I verify emails in bulk?"
    answer: "Yes. Upload CSV, Excel, or text files with thousands of addresses and download cleaned results with risk scores for each email."
  - question: "Do you have an API for email verification?"
    answer: "Yes. BoltRoute offers a REST API with webhooks and real-time status tracking, plus workflow integrations with Zapier, n8n, and Google Sheets for no-code verification."

## Email Lookup Tools Find Addresses - They Don't Verify Them

You traced an email address, found a prospect contact, or scraped a list from a database. The risk starts when you send without verification.

- **Lookup tools do not tell you if an address is valid.** You are sending blind.
- **Invalid emails bounce.** Hard bounces damage sender reputation with every send.
- **Free lookup data is usually the riskiest.** Outdated addresses, catch-alls, and role-based emails end up in your list.
- **One bad campaign can blacklist your domain.** Recovery can take weeks or months.

Finding the email is step one. Verifying it is what keeps your outreach working.

## Complete Your Reverse Email Lookup With Verification

BoltRoute verifies emails you find from any source, tool, or list.

Paste a single address or upload thousands. Get instant results: valid, invalid, risky, or catch-all. Know what is safe before you hit send.

Verification is the step between "found" and "sent" that protects your domain.

## From Lookup to Verified in 3 Steps

1. **Find** addresses with any reverse email lookup tool.
2. **Verify** by pasting one email or uploading a list to BoltRoute.
3. **Send** only to verified, low-risk addresses.

The best reverse lookup workflow does not stop at finding emails. It ends with verification.
