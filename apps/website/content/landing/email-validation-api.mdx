faq:
  - question: "What does the email validation API return?"
    answer: "Each request returns a JSON response with result status (Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, Disposable, Role-based), SMTP validation, syntax check, domain health, and risk score. You get raw data to build your own routing logic."
  - question: "How fast is the email verification API response?"
    answer: "Single-email verification returns results in milliseconds for most requests. Response time varies based on the receiving mail server, but typical lookups complete in under one second."
  - question: "Can I validate emails in bulk via API?"
    answer: "Yes. You can submit batch requests through the API and receive results via webhook when processing completes. For file-based uploads, BoltRoute also supports CSV, Excel, and text files through the dashboard."
  - question: "Do you support catch-all and role-based email detection?"
    answer: "Yes. The API flags both catch-all domains, which accept any address, and role-based emails like info@ or support@. You can configure how your system handles each type."
  - question: "What happens after my 100 free verifications?"
    answer: "You need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue. Plans start at $29/month for 10,000 credits. Credits never expire, so you only pay for what you use."

## Bad Email Data Breaks Everything Downstream

Invalid emails do not just bounce. They create bigger problems:

- **Database pollution.** Bad addresses corrupt user data and skew any metric tied to it.
- **Sender reputation damage.** Hard bounces signal poor list hygiene, and transactional emails can start landing in spam.
- **Scaling nightmares.** Manual cleaning does not work when you process hundreds of signups per hour.
- **Future deliverability debt.** Every invalid address you store today is a bounce waiting to happen later.

Catching bad emails after they enter your system always costs more than blocking them at entry.

## Validate Emails at the Point of Entry

BoltRoute's email validation API catches invalid addresses before they reach your database.

Verify at signup, checkout, or form submission. The API returns actionable results so your code can route each address as Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, Disposable, or Role-based.

One API call. Clean data in. Bad data out.
