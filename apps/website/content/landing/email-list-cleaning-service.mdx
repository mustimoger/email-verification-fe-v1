faq:
  - question: "What does an email list cleaning service actually check?"
    answer: "BoltRoute runs each address through syntax validation, domain health checks, SMTP verification, and risk scoring. You also get detection for catch-all domains, role-based emails like info@ or support@, and disposable addresses."
  - question: "How is email list scrubbing different from verification?"
    answer: "It is the same process. List scrubbing, list cleaning, and email verification all refer to removing invalid and risky addresses before sending."
  - question: "Can I use BoltRoute as a list cleaner for large files?"
    answer: "Yes. Bulk upload supports CSV, Excel, and TXT files. Upload your list and download cleaned results with risk categories attached."
  - question: "How does BoltRoute handle catch-all and role-based emails?"
    answer: "Catch-all domains accept all emails, which makes true verification impossible. BoltRoute flags these addresses and lets you choose how to handle them: keep, flag, or remove. The same applies to role-based emails."
  - question: "Does email hygiene really affect deliverability?"
    answer: "Yes. Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft monitor sender reputation. High bounce rates signal poor list quality, which can push your emails to spam or get your domain blacklisted. Cleaning your list before sending reduces bounces and protects reputation."
  - question: "Is there a free trial for the email list cleaning tools?"
    answer: "BoltRoute offers 100 free verifications with no credit card required so you can test it on your own list before committing."

## Dirty Lists Kill Deliverability

Every invalid email on your list creates risk:

- **Hard bounces trigger ISP penalties.** Too many bounces and your domain gets flagged or blacklisted.
- **Bad data wastes money.** You pay for every send, and invalid addresses waste credits and distort performance metrics.
- **Poor email hygiene lands you in spam.** Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook monitor sender reputation, and dirty lists reduce inbox placement.

Domain reputation can take months to rebuild. List cleaning takes minutes.

## Clean Your List Before You Hit Send

BoltRoute is an email list cleaner that catches bad addresses before they hurt sender reputation. Upload your list, verify in bulk, or connect via API and send only to addresses that exist.

## Email List Cleaning Tools Built for Scale

**Bulk File Verification**  
Upload CSV, Excel, or TXT files and clean thousands of emails in one job. Download results with risk categories.

**SMTP Validation + Syntax Check**  
BoltRoute checks mailbox existence at the server level and catches invalid addresses that basic syntax checks miss.

**Catch-All and Role Email Detection**  
Configurable handling for risky address types. Flag, remove, or keep them based on your process.

**Risk Scoring**  
Each address gets a classification: Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, Role-based, or Disposable.

**List Scrubbing via API**  
Connect through REST API, Zapier, n8n, or Google Sheets and verify inside existing workflows.

## Clean Your Email List in 3 Steps

1. **Upload your list**  
Drag and drop a CSV, Excel, or TXT file, or connect via API for automated scrubbing.
2. **BoltRoute verifies every address**  
Each email runs through syntax checks, domain health validation, and SMTP verification. Catch-alls and role emails are flagged.
3. **Download your cleaned list**  
Export results with risk categories, keep valid addresses, and remove the rest.
