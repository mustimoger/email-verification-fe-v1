faq:
  - question: "What makes BoltRoute different from other email verification tools?"
    answer: "BoltRoute is workflow-first. Most tools force export-upload-download-reimport cycles. BoltRoute verifies directly inside Zapier, n8n, and Google Sheets, plus a REST API for developers who need verification embedded in apps."
  - question: "Is this the best email checker for cold email senders?"
    answer: "BoltRoute is built for senders who protect their domains. It flags catch-alls, disposable addresses, and role-based emails - the risky contacts that hurt deliverability even when they do not bounce immediately."
  - question: "Do you offer an email verification API?"
    answer: "Yes. BoltRoute provides a REST API with webhooks and real-time status tracking. It is designed to fit existing developer stacks and automation workflows."
  - question: "Can I try BoltRoute free?"
    answer: "Yes. You get 100 free verifications with no credit card required. You can upload a file or test single addresses in browser."
  - question: "What results do I get for each email?"
    answer: "Each address returns a status: Valid, Invalid, Risky, Catch-all, Role-based, or Disposable. You also get diagnostics including SMTP validation, domain health, and risk score."
  - question: "Do credits expire?"
    answer: "No. Credits never expire."

## Sending to Bad Addresses Costs More Than Bounces

Every invalid email chips away at sender reputation:

- **Hard bounces** signal poor list maintenance to inbox providers.
- **Spam traps** can get your domain blacklisted without warning.
- **Disposable and role-based emails** inflate list size but do not convert.
- **One bad send** can hurt deliverability for weeks or months.

The damage compounds, and recovery is slow once your domain is flagged.

## Verify Before You Send

BoltRoute catches bad addresses before they damage your reputation.

Upload a list, connect via API, or verify inside the tools you already use. Whether you are cleaning a prospect file or validating signups in real time, BoltRoute is built for teams that need reliable verification without added complexity.

**Bulk File Verification**  
Upload CSV, Excel, or text files, then download cleaned results segmented by valid, invalid, and risky statuses.

**Email Checker API**  
Verify addresses programmatically with a REST API, webhooks, and status tracking.

**Workflow Integrations**  
Run verification inside Zapier, n8n, or Google Sheets with no manual export cycles.

**Instant Single Verification**

**Risk Scoring and Diagnostics**
