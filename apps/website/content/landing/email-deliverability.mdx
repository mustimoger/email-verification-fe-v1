faq:
  - question: "Can BoltRoute replace an email deliverability agency?"
    answer: "For list verification and hygiene, yes. BoltRoute automates what agencies charge thousands to do manually: validating addresses, flagging risky emails, and cleaning lists before you send. For strategic consulting on content, sending patterns, or IP warming, you may still want human expertise."
  - question: "What do email deliverability consultants actually check?"
    answer: "Typically: list hygiene, authentication setup (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC), sender reputation, and bounce rates. BoltRoute handles the list hygiene and verification layer - the foundation that makes everything else work."
  - question: "How is this different from hiring email deliverability agencies?"
    answer: "Speed and cost. Agencies take weeks and charge monthly retainers. BoltRoute verifies lists in minutes at a fraction of the price. You get the same clean-list output without waiting or overpaying."
  - question: "What does the email deliverability audit include?"
    answer: "SMTP validation, syntax checks, domain health analysis, risk scoring, catch-all detection, and role-based email flagging. Results are downloadable or can be pushed to your workflow tools."
  - question: "Do I need deliverability experts if I use BoltRoute?"
    answer: "For verification, no - BoltRoute handles the technical checks automatically. For broader deliverability strategy like authentication, IP reputation, and inbox provider relations, combine BoltRoute's data with internal expertise or a consultant for complex cases."

## Hiring an Email Deliverability Consultant Shouldn't Cost $5K/Month

Your bounce rates are climbing. Open rates are dropping. You know something is broken.

The usual fix is to hire an email deliverability consultant. But consultants charge thousands for audits that take weeks to deliver. Your team does not have time to become deliverability experts, and every bad send in the meantime damages the domain reputation you spent months building.

You do not need a retainer. You need clean lists now.

## Email Deliverability Consulting, Automated

BoltRoute delivers the core output of email deliverability consulting - clean lists and verified addresses - without the billable hours.

Verify before you send. Single emails, bulk files, or programmatically via API. What used to require a consultant now takes seconds.
