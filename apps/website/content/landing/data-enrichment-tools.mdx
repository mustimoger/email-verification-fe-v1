faq:
  - question: "What is data enrichment?"
    answer: "Data enrichment is the process of enhancing your existing contacts with additional information like emails, phone numbers, job titles, and company data. Tools like Apollo, Clearbit, and ZoomInfo specialize in this. BoltRoute does not enrich data - it verifies the emails those tools provide."
  - question: "Why do I need to verify enriched emails?"
    answer: "Enrichment tools pull from databases that decay over time. People change jobs, companies close, and emails get deactivated. Sending to unverified enriched lists leads to bounces, spam complaints, and damaged sender reputation. Verification catches bad addresses before you send."
  - question: "Can I verify emails via API as I enrich?"
    answer: "Yes. BoltRoute offers a REST API with webhooks for real-time verification. You can build verification directly into your enrichment workflow and verify emails the moment they enter your system."
  - question: "What file formats does BoltRoute accept?"
    answer: "CSV, Excel (XLSX), and TXT files. Drag and drop your enriched export, then download a verified list with risk scores."
  - question: "How does BoltRoute handle catch-all domains?"
    answer: "Catch-all domains accept any email sent to them, which makes verification harder. BoltRoute flags catch-all addresses in your results so you can decide whether to send, skip, or handle them separately."
  - question: "Do credits expire?"
    answer: "No. Credits never expire, so you can use them whenever you need them."

## Enriched Data Doesn't Mean Verified Data

Data enrichment tools pull emails from third-party databases. Those databases decay faster than you think.

- **Stale records:** People change jobs, companies shut down, and emails get deactivated.
- **No validation at source:** Enrichment tools find emails, but they do not confirm deliverability.
- **Sender reputation at risk:** One campaign to a bad list can damage your domain for months.
- **Spam traps hiding in plain sight:** Recycled emails become traps that flag you as a spammer.

You paid for enriched data. Do not pay again with your deliverability.

## Verify Every Enriched Email Before It Hits Your Outbox

BoltRoute sits between your enrichment tool and your sending platform. You get emails from Apollo, Clearbit, Clay, or ZoomInfo, and we tell you which ones will not bounce.

Upload your enriched lists and download verified, send-ready contacts. No more guessing which emails are safe.

## Built for Data Enrichment Workflows

BoltRoute plugs into the gap between enrichment and outreach. Verify emails your way, with bulk files or real-time API.
