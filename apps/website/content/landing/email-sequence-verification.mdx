faq:
  - question: "How do I verify an email sequence list before sending?"
    answer: "Upload your prospect list as a CSV, Excel, or text file. BoltRoute verifies each address and returns a cleaned file with status tags (valid, invalid, risky, catch-all). Load the verified file into your sequence tool and send."
  - question: "What else affects cold email deliverability besides list verification?"
    answer: "Typical factors include list hygiene, authentication setup (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC), sender reputation, and bounce rates. BoltRoute handles the list hygiene and verification layer - the foundation that makes everything else work."
  - question: "What's the difference between invalid, risky, and catch-all emails?"
    answer: "Invalid emails will hard bounce because the address or domain does not exist. Risky emails show warning signals like disposable providers or low-reputation domains. Catch-all domains accept all emails regardless of whether a specific address exists, so delivery is uncertain."
  - question: "Can I verify emails inside my cold email tool?"
    answer: "BoltRoute integrates with Zapier, n8n, and Google Sheets. You can also connect directly via REST API or webhooks to verify emails in real time as they enter your CRM or sequence."
  - question: "Do you provide cold email examples or templates?"
    answer: "BoltRoute verifies email addresses - we do not write sequences. Verified lists improve results regardless of template because fewer bounces mean more emails delivered."
  - question: "How fast is bulk verification?"
    answer: "Most lists under 10,000 emails verify within minutes. Larger lists take longer depending on volume and domain response times."
  - question: "Is there a free trial?"
    answer: "Yes. You get 100 free verifications when you sign up, with no credit card required. Test on real addresses before you commit."

## Cold Sequences Fail When You're Sending to Bad Addresses

Your email sequence tool does not know which addresses are dead. It just sends, and your domain pays the price.

- **Bounce rates above 2%** trigger spam filters and throttling
- **Invalid emails waste sequence slots** and keep your team nurturing ghosts
- **One bad campaign** can tank sender reputation for weeks
- **Prospect lists decay 20-30% per year** and last quarter's data is already rotting

The problem is not your copy or offer. It is sending to addresses that were never going to receive anything.

## Turn Email Prospecting Into a Repeatable System

The fix is not sending fewer emails. The fix is verifying every address before it enters your sequence.

BoltRoute checks your prospect list against SMTP, domain health, and risk signals so your cold outreach tool only sends to addresses that can receive mail. Clean lists in, completed sequences out.

## Why Sales Teams Choose BoltRoute for Cold Email Campaigns

The best cold email tools handle sequencing. BoltRoute handles what comes before by making sure your list is clean.

**Bulk List Verification**  
Upload your prospect CSV or Excel file and get a cleaned file back with valid, invalid, and risky emails tagged, ready for your sequencer.

**Real-Time API**  
Verify emails at point of capture and stop bad addresses from entering your CRM or cold email marketing software.

**Catch-All and Risky Detection**  
Catch-all domains accept everything, including fake addresses. BoltRoute flags them so you can decide whether to send or skip.

**Workflow Integrations**  
Verify inside Zapier, n8n, or Google Sheets with no manual exports and no tab switching.

**Risk Scoring and Diagnostics**  
See why an email failed, including syntax errors, dead domains, SMTP rejection, or disposable providers.

## Verify Your Email Sequence List in 3 Steps

**1. Upload Your List**  
Drag your CSV, Excel, or text file into BoltRoute, map your email column, and start verification.

**2. Verify Every Address**  
BoltRoute runs syntax checks, domain validation, and SMTP verification. Risky addresses are flagged with reason codes.

**3. Download and Send**  
Export your cleaned list with status tags and load the verified file into your sequence tool.
