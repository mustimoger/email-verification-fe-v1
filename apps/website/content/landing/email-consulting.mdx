faq:
  - question: "Can a tool really replace an email consultant?"
    answer: "For list verification and hygiene, yes. BoltRoute runs SMTP checks, domain validation, and risk scoring that a consultant would perform manually. You get diagnostic data instantly. For strategic deliverability consulting like IP warming plans or custom domain setups, you may still want human expertise, but BoltRoute handles the data cleanup work that can take consultants weeks."
  - question: "What does email consulting typically include?"
    answer: "Most email consultants offer list audits, deliverability diagnostics, and remediation advice. BoltRoute automates the audit and diagnostics portion: upload your list, get risk scores for every address, and download clean results. The main difference is speed, cost, and repeatability."
  - question: "How accurate is automated email verification?"
    answer: "BoltRoute uses SMTP validation, syntax checks, and domain health analysis to classify emails as valid, invalid, risky, catch-all, role-based, or disposable. No verification tool can guarantee 100% accuracy because catch-all domains accept all addresses by design, but automated checks remove obvious bad data that causes bounces."
  - question: "Do I need technical skills to use BoltRoute?"
    answer: "No. Upload a CSV or Excel file and download cleaned results, or verify directly in Google Sheets. If you want automation, Zapier and n8n integrations require no code. Developers can use the REST API for full control."
  - question: "What if I have millions of emails to verify?"
    answer: "Enterprise plans support 500,000 credits. For 1M+ verifications, contact us for custom pricing. Bulk uploads and API access are built for high-volume workflows."

BoltRoute delivers the list hygiene intelligence you would pay a consultant thousands for.

No credit card required.

## Hiring an Email Consultant Is Expensive and Slow

Email consultants charge $150-300/hour. A full list audit can take weeks. After that, you are still left doing the cleanup yourself.

- **High cost:** Retainers and hourly fees add up before you see results
- **Slow turnaround:** Weeks of back-and-forth for a single audit
- **No ongoing protection:** One-time audits do not stop bad data from piling up tomorrow

Every day with unverified emails on your list increases bounce risk, spam complaints, and sender reputation damage.

## What If You Could Skip the Email Consultant?

BoltRoute gives you the same deliverability diagnostics a consultant would, without meetings, invoices, or waiting.

Verify emails instantly. Get risk scores, domain health checks, and actionable data. Do it on your schedule at a fraction of the cost.

## Email Consulting Intelligence, Built Into a Tool

BoltRoute packages consultant-level diagnostics into a self-serve platform.

**SMTP Validation + Domain Health Checks**  
See mail server responses, domain configuration, and sending risk without scheduling a call.

**Risk Scoring for Every Address**  
Each email is flagged as valid, invalid, risky, catch-all, role-based, or disposable, so you know what to keep and remove.

**Bulk Verification in Minutes**  
Upload CSV, Excel, or text files and download cleaned results quickly.

**API + Workflow Integrations**  
Verify emails inside Zapier, n8n, or Google Sheets with no manual audits or copy-pasting.

## Built for Workflows You Already Use

BoltRoute integrates with the tools your team already relies on:

- **Zapier** - Trigger verifications from any connected app
- **n8n** - Build custom verification workflows
- **Google Sheets** - Verify lists without leaving your spreadsheet
- **REST API + Webhooks** - Embed verification into any system

More integrations are coming soon.

## Consultant Fees vs. BoltRoute

A single hour with an email consultant costs $150-300. BoltRoute gives you unlimited access to the same diagnostic tools starting at $29/month.
