Active plan and progress tracking live in:
- `new-design.md` (dashboard redesign + `/verify-v2` functional migration)
- `newpricing.md` (pricing v2 rollout)

Recent updates to check in `new-design.md`:
- `/history-v2` audit, redesign, responsive QA, and functional migration (D4h–D4k)
- Sidebar redesign rollout (D4g) + QA captures
- Repo hygiene tasks (D7) for local QA artifacts
- `/api-v2` audit, UI redesign, responsive QA, functional wiring, and `/api` swap (D4r–D4v)
- `/api` QA captures after the swap (D5d)

Recent updates to check in `newpricing.md`:
- `/pricing` route now renders the v2 pricing experience; legacy pricing moved to `/pricing-v2` for rollback access.
- Playwright QA on `/pricing` flagged annual pricing display math as off by ~12x (tracked in T9 for fix).

Handoff note:
- `handover.md` was intentionally removed per user request; rely on `newpricing.md` + this file for current next steps.

This file is reserved as a pointer to the current plans for future sessions.
